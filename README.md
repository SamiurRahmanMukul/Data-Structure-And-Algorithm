# Data Structure & Algorithm with C Programming Language

<!-- article of data structure -->

  <h3>What is Data Structure ?</h3>
  
  <p>To simply put, data structure is an orderly arrangement of data in computers to use it in a more efficient manner. It is a collection of data objects that allows storing, organizing, and retrieving data on systems.</p>

  <p>A majority of data structures are inspired from real life scenarios. For instance, have you been scolded by your parents for not being able to find a particular outfit in your messy wardrobe? Yes, right? Your parents give the advice to keep your clothes in a systematic manner so the next time you want something you can easily pick it up. In this situation, you need to arrange &amp; keep your clothes (data) in such a structure that when searching for a particular thing you don’t have to hassle much.</p>

  <p>We are using data structures in our everyday lives without even knowing it. From our contact list, book piles to organizing hierarchy or to-do list, we are applying different arrangement techniques which are called as data structures in the computing realm. Data structure provides the right way to organize information in the digital space.</p>

  <p>The data structure is a key component of Computer Science and is largely used in the areas of Artificial Intelligence, operating systems, graphics, etc.</p>

  <p>Data structures store objects and allow their manipulation on the basis of two different types:</p>

  <h3>What is an Algorithm ?</h3>

  <p>Algorithm refers to a set of steps used in completing a certain task or to get a desired output. It is like building blocks for programming that allows smartphones, computers or websites to function smoothly and make decisions. Each code written by a programmer is a collective formation of algorithms navigating what to do. Algorithms are well-defined procedures that help computers to solve problems.</p>

  <p>Let’s take a simple example of GPS. When you search a location, GPS uses an algorithm to search for multiple available routes, also for checking the current traffic GPS uses a different algorithm, based on the collective information it provides the best available route for you. All these algorithms are in-built&nbsp; &nbsp;into the GPS’ code. So, if there is any error in the code of GPS, it won’t function correctly, thus provide incorrect direction. Computers use algorithms to calculate things much faster than the humans.</p>

  <h3>What is relationship between Data Structures and Algorithm ?</h3>

  <p>Both Data structures and algorithms are interrelated and complement each other. An algorithm applies to a particular data structure, while using the right data structure helps to drastically improve the performance of an algorithm. Hence, we can’t detach data structures and algorithms.</p>

  <p>
    <strong>Following are the main categories of algorithms in relation to data structures:</strong>
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Insert</strong> – To insert an item in a data structure, this algorithm is applicable.</li>
    <li><strong>Update</strong> – The update algorithm is useful for updating an existing item in a data structure.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete</strong> – In order to delete an existing item from a data structure, you can use the delete algorithm.</li>
    <li><strong>Search</strong> – This algorithm helps in finding an item in a data structure.</li>
    <li><strong>Sort</strong> – This algorithm is helps to sort items in a specific order.</li>
  </ul>
